## Arcade Game

### To start the game

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* open index.html in a browser

First, the user has to choose one of the five possible Player figures. Once they click on a Player figure, the game starts. The goal of the game is to reach the water, moving the Player figure with arrow keys without colliding into any of the three Enemies (bugs), moving across the field. If the Player touches an Enemy, the game is over and a "Game over" message appears. The user might choose to start the game again by clicking a button on the message field. If the Player reaches the water without running into Enemies, success message is shown and the user might restart the game.

Arcade Game is written using Object Oriented Programming concepts.
